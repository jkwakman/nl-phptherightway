## PEAR {#pear_title}

Another veteran package manager that many PHP developers enjoy is [PEAR][1]. It behaves much the same way as Composer,
but has some notable differences.

PEAR requires each package to have a specific structure, which means that the author of the package must prepare it
for usage with PEAR. Using a project which was not prepared to work with PEAR is not possible.

PEAR installs packages globally, which means after installing them once they are available to all projects on that
server. This can be good if many projects rely on the same package with the same version but might lead to problems
if version conflicts between two projects arise.

### How to install PEAR

You can install PEAR by downloading the phar installer and executing it. The PEAR documentation has detailed 
[install instructions][2] for every operating system.

If you are using Linux, you can also have a look at your distribution package manager. Debian and Ubuntu, for example,
have an apt ``php-pear`` package.

### How to install a package

If the package is listed on the [PEAR packages list][3], you can install it by specifying the official name:

    pear install foo
    
If the package is hosted on another channel, you need to `discover` the channel first and also specify it when 
installing. See the [Using channel docs][4] for more information on this topic.

### Handling PEAR dependencies with Composer

If you are already using [Composer][5] and you would like to install some PEAR code too, you can use 
Composer to handle your PEAR dependencies. This example will install code from `pear2.php.net`:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "pear",
            "url": "http://pear2.php.net"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "pear-pear2/PEAR2_Text_Markdown": "*",
        "pear-pear2/PEAR2_HTTP_Request": "*"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The first section `"repositories"` will be used to let Composer know it should "initialise" 
(or "discover" in PEAR terminology) the pear repo. Then the require section will prefix the package 
name like this:

> pear-channel/Package

The "pear" prefix is hardcoded to avoid any conflicts, as a pear channel could be the same as another packages vendor name for example, then the channel short name (or full URL) can be used 
to reference which channel the package is in.

When this code is installed it will be available in your vendor directory and automatically 
available through the Composer autoloader:

> vendor/pear-pear2.php.net/PEAR2_HTTP_Request/pear2/HTTP/Request.php

To use this PEAR package simply reference it like so:

{% highlight php %}
$request = new pear2\HTTP\Request();
{% endhighlight %}
