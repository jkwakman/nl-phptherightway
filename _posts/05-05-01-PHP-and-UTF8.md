## Working with UTF-8 {#php_and_utf8_title}

_This section was originally written by [Alex Cabal](https://alexcabal.com/) over at 
[PHP Best Practices](https://phpbestpractices.org/#utf-8) and has been used as the basis for our own UTF-8 advice_.

### There's no one-liner. Be careful, detailed, and consistent.

Right now PHP does not support Unicode at a low level. There are ways to ensure that UTF-8 strings are processed OK, 
but it's not easy, and it requires digging in to almost all levels of the web app, from HTML to SQL to PHP. We'll aim 
for a brief, practical summary.

### UTF-8 at the PHP level

The basic string operations, like concatenating two strings and assigning strings to variables, don't need anything 
special for UTF-8. However most string functions, like `strpos()` and `strlen()`, do need special consideration. These 
functions often have an `mb_*` counterpart: for example, `mb_strpos()` and `mb_strlen()`. These `mb_*` strings are made 
available to you via the [Multibyte String Extension], and are specifically designed to operate on Unicode strings.

You must use the `mb_*` functions whenever you operate on a Unicode string. For example, if you use `substr()` on a 
UTF-8 string, there's a good chance the result will include some garbled half-characters. The correct function to use 
would be the multibyte counterpart, `mb_substr()`.

The hard part is remembering to use the `mb_*` functions at all times. If you forget even just once, your Unicode 
string has a chance of being garbled during further processing.

Not all string functions have an `mb_*` counterpart. If there isn't one for what you want to do, then you might be out 
of luck.

You should use the `mb_internal_encoding()` function at the top of every PHP script you write (or at the 
top of your global include script), and the `mb_http_output()` function right after it if your script is outputting to 
a browser. Explicitly defining the encoding of your strings in every script will save you a lot of headaches down the 
road.

Additionally, many PHP functions that operate on strings have an optional parameter letting you specify the character 
encoding. You should always explicitly indicate UTF-8 when given the option. For example, `htmlentities()` has an 
option for character encoding, and you should always specify UTF-8 if dealing with such strings. Note that as of PHP 5.4.0, UTF-8 is the default encoding for `htmlentities()` and `htmlspecialchars()`.

Finally, If you are building an distributed application and cannot be certain that the `mbstring` extension will be
enabled, then consider using the [patchwork/utf8] Composer package. This
will use `mbstring` if it is available, and fall back to non UTF-8 functions if not.

### UTF-8 at the Database level

If your PHP script accesses MySQL, there's a chance your strings could be stored as non-UTF-8 strings in the database 
even if you follow all of the precautions above.

To make sure your strings go from PHP to MySQL as UTF-8, make sure your database and tables are all set to the 
`utf8mb4` character set and collation, and that you use the `utf8mb4` character set in the PDO connection string. See 
example code below. This is _critically important_.

Note that you must use the `utf8mb4` character set for complete UTF-8 support, not the `utf8` character set! See 
Further Reading for why.

### UTF-8 at the browser level

Use the `mb_http_output()` function to ensure that your PHP script outputs UTF-8 strings to your browser. 

The browser will then need to be told by the HTTP response that this page should be considered as UTF-8. The historic approach to doing that was to include the [charset `<meta>` tag](http://htmlpurifier.org/docs/enduser-utf8.html) in your page's `<head>` tag. This approach is perfectly valid, but setting the charset in the `Content-Type` header is actually [much faster](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/rendering#SpecifyCharsetEarly).

// Our UTF-8 test string
$string = 'Êl síla erin lû e-govaned vîn.';
 
// Transform the string in some way with a multibyte function
// Note how we cut the string at a non-Ascii character for demonstration purposes
$string = mb_substr($string, 0, 15);
 
// Connect to a database to store the transformed string
// See the PDO example in this document for more information
// Note the `set names utf8mb4` commmand!
$link = new \PDO(   
                    'mysql:host=your-hostname;dbname=your-db;charset=utf8mb4',
                    'your-username',

                    )
                );
 
// Store our transformed string as UTF-8 in our database
// Your DB and tables are in the utf8mb4 character set and collation, right?
$handle = $link->prepare('insert into ElvishSentences (Id, Body) values (?, ?)');
$handle->bindValue(1, 1, PDO::PARAM_INT);
$handle->bindValue(2, $string);
$handle->execute();
 
// Retrieve the string we just stored to prove it was stored correctly
$handle = $link->prepare('select * from ElvishSentences where Id = ?');
$handle->bindValue(1, 1, PDO::PARAM_INT);
$handle->execute();
 
// Store the result into an object that we'll output later in our HTML
$result = $handle->fetchAll(\PDO::FETCH_OBJ);

header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8');
