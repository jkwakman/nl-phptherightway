# PHPDoc {#phpdoc}

PHPDoc is an informal standard for commenting PHP code. There are a *lot* of different [tags](http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/references/phpdoc/tags/index.html) available. The full list of tags and examples can be found at the [PHPDoc manual](http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/index.html).

Below is an example of how you might document a class with a few methods;

{% highlight php %}
<?php
/**
 * @author A Name <a.name@example.com>
 * @link http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/index.html
 * @package helper
 */
class DateTimeHelper
{
    /**
     * @param mixed $anything Anything that we can convert to a \DateTime object
     *
     * @return \DateTime
     * @throws \InvalidArgumentException
     */
    public function dateTimeFromAnything($anything)
    {
        $type = gettype($anything);

        switch ($type) {
            // Some code that tries to return a \DateTime object
        }

        throw new \InvalidArgumentException(
            "Failed Converting param of type '{$type}' to DateTime object"
        );
    }

    /**
     * @param mixed $date Anything that we can convert to a \DateTime object
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function printISO8601Date($date)
    {
        echo $this->dateTimeFromAnything($date)->format('c');
    }

    /**
     * @param mixed $date Anything that we can convert to a \DateTime object
     */
    public function printRFC2822Date($date)
    {
        echo $this->dateTimeFromAnything($date)->format('r');
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The documentation for the class as a whole firstly has the [@author](http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/references/phpdoc/tags/author.html) tag, this tag is used to document the author of the code and can be repeated for documenting several authors. Secondly is the [@link](http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/references/phpdoc/tags/link.html) tag, used to link to a website indicating a relationship between the website and the code. Thirdly it has the [@package](http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/references/phpdoc/tags/package.html) tag, used to categorize the code.

Inside the class, the first method has an [@param](http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/references/phpdoc/tags/param.html) tag documenting the type, name and description of the parameter being passed to the method. Additionally it has the [@return](http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/references/phpdoc/tags/return.html) and [@throws](http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/references/phpdoc/tags/throws.html) tags for documenting the return type, and any exceptions that could be throw respectively.

The second and third methods are very similar and have a single [@param](http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/references/phpdoc/tags/param.html) tag as did the first method. The import difference between the second and third method is doc block is the inclusion/exclusion of the [@return](http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/references/phpdoc/tags/return.html) tag. `@return void` explicitly informs us that there is no return, historically omitting the `@return void` statement also results in the same (no return) action.
