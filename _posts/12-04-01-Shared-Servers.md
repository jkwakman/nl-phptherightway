## Shared Servers {#shared_servers_title}

PHP has shared servers to thank for its popularity. It is hard to find a host without PHP installed, but be sure it's the latest version. Shared servers allow you and other developers to deploy websites to a single machine. The upside to this is that it has become a cheap commodity. The downside is that you never know what kind of a ruckus your neighboring tenants are going to create; loading down the server or opening up security holes are the main concerns. If your project's budget can afford to avoid shared servers you should.
