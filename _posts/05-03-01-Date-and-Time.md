## Date and Time {#date_and_time_title}

PHP has a class named DateTime to help you when reading, writing, comparing or calculating with date and time. There are
many date and time related functions in PHP besides DateTime, but it provides nice object-oriented interface to most
common uses. It can handle time zones, but that is outside this short introduction.

To start working with DateTime, convert raw date and time string to an object with `createFromFormat()` factory method
or do `new \DateTime` to get the current date and time. Use `format()` method to convert DateTime back to a string for
output.
{% highlight php %}
<?php
$raw = '22. 11. 1968';
$start = \DateTime::createFromFormat('d. m. Y', $raw);

echo 'Start date: ' . $start->format('m/d/Y') . "\n";
{% endhighlight %}

Calculating with DateTime is possible with the DateInterval class. DateTime has methods like `add()` and `sub()` that
take a DateInterval as an argument. Do not write code that expect same number of seconds in every day, both daylight
saving and timezone alterations will break that assumption. Use date intervals instead. To calculate date difference use
the `diff()` method. It will return new DateInterval, which is super easy to display.
{% highlight php %}
<?php
// create a copy of $start and add one month and 6 days
$end = clone $start;
$end->add(new \DateInterval('P1M6D'));

$diff = $end->diff($start);
echo 'Difference: ' . $diff->format('%m month, %d days (total: %a days)') . "\n";
// Difference: 1 month, 6 days (total: 37 days)
{% endhighlight %}

On DateTime objects you can use standard comparison:
{% highlight php %}
<?php
if ($start < $end) {
    echo "Start is before end!\n";
}
{% endhighlight %}

One last example to demonstrate the DatePeriod class. It is used to iterate over recurring events. It can take two
DateTime objects, start and end, and the interval for which it will return all events in between.
{% highlight php %}
<?php
// output all thursdays between $start and $end
$periodInterval = \DateInterval::createFromDateString('first thursday');
$periodIterator = new \DatePeriod($start, $periodInterval, $end, \DatePeriod::EXCLUDE_START_DATE);
foreach ($periodIterator as $date) {
    // output each date in the period
    echo $date->format('m/d/Y') . ' ';
}
{% endhighlight %}
