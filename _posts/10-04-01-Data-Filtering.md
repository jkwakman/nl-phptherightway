## Data Filtering {#data_filtering_title}

Never ever (ever) trust foreign input introduced to your PHP code. Always sanitize and validate
foreign input before using it in code. The `filter_var` and `filter_input` functions can sanitize text and validate text formats (e.g.
email addresses).

Foreign input can be anything: `$_GET` and `$_POST` form input data, some values in the `$_SERVER`
superglobal, and the HTTP request body via `fopen('php://input', 'r')`. Remember, foreign input is not
limited to form data submitted by the user. Uploaded and downloaded files, session values, cookie data,
and data from third-party web services are foreign input, too.

While foreign data can be stored, combined, and accessed later, it is still foreign input. Every
time you process, output, concatenate, or include data in your code, ask yourself if
the data is filtered properly and can it be trusted.

Data may be _filtered_ differently based on its purpose. For example, when unfiltered foreign input is passed
into HTML page output, it can execute HTML and JavaScript on your site! This is known as Cross-Site
Scripting (XSS) and can be a very dangerous attack. One way to avoid XSS is to sanitize all user-generated
data before outputting it to your page by removing HTML tags with the `strip_tags` function or escaping
characters with special meaning into their respective HTML entities with the `htmlentities`
or `htmlspecialchars` functions.

Another example is passing options to be executed on the command line. This can be extremely dangerous
(and is usually a bad idea), but you can use the built-in `escapeshellarg` function to sanitize the executed
command's arguments.

One last example is accepting foreign input to determine a file to load from the filesystem. This can be exploited by
changing the filename to a file path. You need to remove "/", "../", [null bytes][6], or other characters from the file path so it can't
load hidden, non-public, or sensitive files.

### Sanitization

Sanitization removes (or escapes) illegal or unsafe characters from foreign input.

For example, you should sanitize foreign input before including the input in HTML or inserting it
into a raw SQL query. When you use bound parameters with [PDO](#databases), it will
sanitize the input for you.

Sometimes it is required to allow some safe HTML tags in the input when including it in the HTML
page. This is very hard to do and many avoid it by using other more restricted formatting like
Markdown or BBCode, although whitelisting libraries like [HTML Purifier][html-purifier] exists for
this reason.

### Validation

Validation ensures that foreign input is what you expect. For example, you may want to validate an
email address, a phone number, or age when processing a registration submission.
