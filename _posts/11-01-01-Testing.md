# Testing {#testing_title}

Writing automated tests for your PHP code is considered a best practice and can lead to well-built
applications. Automated tests are a great tool for making sure your application
does not break when you are making changes or adding new functionality and should not be ignored.

There are several different types of testing tools (or frameworks) available for PHP, which use 
different approaches - all of which are trying to avoid manual testing and the need for large 
Quality Assurance teams, just to make sure recent changes didn't break existing functionality.
