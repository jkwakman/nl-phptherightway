## Use the Current Stable Version (5.6) {#use_the_current_stable_version_title}

If you are getting started with PHP, start with the current stable release of [PHP 5.6][php-release]. PHP has added powerful [new features](#language_highlights) over the last few years. Though the incremental version number difference between 5.2 and 5.6 is small, it represents _major_ improvements. If you are looking for a function or its usage, the documentation on the [php.net][php-docs] website will have the answer.
