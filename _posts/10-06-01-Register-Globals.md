## Register Globals {#register_globals_title}

**NOTE:** As of PHP 5.4.0 the `register_globals` setting has been removed and can no 
longer be used. This is only included as a warning for anyone in the process of upgrading a legacy application.

When enabled, the `register_globals` configuration setting that makes several types of variables (including ones from 
`$_POST`, `$_GET` and `$_REQUEST`) available in the global scope of your application. This can easily lead to 
security issues as your application cannot effectively tell where the data is coming from.

For example: `$_GET['foo']` would be available via `$foo`, which can override variables that have not been declared. 
If you are using PHP < 5.4.0 __make sure__ that `register_globals` is __off__.
