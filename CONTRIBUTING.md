## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to add new content to PHP The Right Way, as well 
as updating any browser issues or other style changes. Pretty much any sort of 
change is accepted if seen as constructive.

Adhering to the following this process is the best way to get your work
included in the project:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/php-the-right-way.git
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd php-the-right-way
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/codeguy/php-the-right-way.git
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout gh-pages
   git pull upstream gh-pages
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your change or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Install the [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) gem to preview locally.

5. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your content is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

6. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream gh-pages
   ```

7. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

8. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.
